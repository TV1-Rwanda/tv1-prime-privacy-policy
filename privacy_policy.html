      <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        We do not collect any personal information about you through the App.
        This means we do not collect data such as your name, email address,
        phone number, location, or any other identifiers.
      </p>
      <h2>Information you provide by email</h2>
      <p>
        The only time we may receive your information is if you choose to
        contact us directly through the email address provided within this

      <h2>Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        We will not share, sell, or otherwise distribute any information you
        provide by email to any third party without your consent, except as
        required by law.

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      We take reasonable steps to protect the information you provide by email
      from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However,
